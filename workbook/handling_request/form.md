#Handling Requests: Form/Query Data
==================================
An HTML Form can handle GET and POST requests.
When we use a form with method GET, the data is attached at the end of the url for example:

http://wwww.example.com?key1=value1&...keyn=valuen

If we use the method POST, the data is sent to the server in a different line.

Extracting form data from the server side is one of the most tedious parts.
